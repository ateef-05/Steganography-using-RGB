# Steganography-using-RGB
So this project can be used for Hiding an secret message inside an image by using an method call RGB and ASCII value
The RGB method is a common technique used in image steganography to hide secret data within the pixels of a digital image. The basic idea is to encode the secret data into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the red, green, and blue (RGB) color values of the image pixels.
Here's how the RGB method for image steganography works:
Encoding the Secret Data
The secret data (e.g. text, image, or other file) is first converted into binary format.
The binary data is then embedded into the LSBs of the RGB color values of the image pixels. Specifically:
The first 3 bits of the binary data are stored in the LSBs of the red channel.
The next 3 bits are stored in the LSBs of the green channel.
The final 2 bits are stored in the LSBs of the blue channel.
This process is repeated for each group of 8 bits (1 byte) of the binary data, using consecutive pixels to hold the encoded information.
Decoding the Secret Data
To extract the hidden data, the decoder reads the LSBs of the RGB values for each pixel in the same order as the encoding process.
The LSBs are concatenated back into the original binary data, which is then converted back into the secret message or file.
The main advantage of the RGB method is that it can hide a significant amount of data within an image without drastically changing the visual appearance of the image. However, it is also relatively easy to detect the presence of hidden data using statistical analysis techniques.
To improve the security and robustness of RGB-based image steganography, researchers have proposed various techniques such as using encryption, pixel indicator methods, and matrix patterns. These advanced methods aim to make the hidden data more difficult to detect and extract without the proper decryption key or knowledge of the encoding algorithm.
